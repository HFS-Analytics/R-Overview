# R-Overview

Notes on using R from HFS internal experiences.

*Caveat:* The author is old and stuck in his ways. He learned R shortly before the `tidyverse` became popular and never took the time to relearn everything in that paradigm. As a result, these notes rely heavily on Base R ('vanilla R') capabilities. Motivated learners are encouraged to explore the tidyverse to their hearts' content.
